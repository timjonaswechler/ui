# Accessibility

<Description>
  Radix Primitives follow the WAI-ARIA authoring practices guidelines and are
  tested in a wide selection of modern browsers and commonly used assistive
  technologies.
</Description>

We take care of many of the difficult implementation details related to accessibility, including `aria` and `role` attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation. That means that users should be able to use our components as-is in most contexts and rely on functionality to follow the expected accessibility design patterns.

## Keyboard Navigation

Many complex components, like [`Tabs`](../components/tabs) and [`Dialog`](../components/dialog), come with expectations from users on how to interact with their content using a keyboard or other non-mouse input modalities. Radix Primitives provide basic keyboard support in accordance with the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/).

## Focus Management

Proper keyboard navigation and good labelling often go hand-in-hand with managing focus. When a user interacts with an element and something changes as a result, it's often helpful to move focus with the interaction so that the next tab stop is logical depending on the new context of the app. And for screen reader users, moving focus often results in an announcement to convey this new context, which relies on proper labelling.

In many Radix Primitives, we move focus based on the interactions a user normally takes in a given component. For example, in [`AlertDialog`](../components/alert-dialog), when the modal is opened, focus is programmatically moved to a `Cancel` button element to anticipate a response to the prompt.
