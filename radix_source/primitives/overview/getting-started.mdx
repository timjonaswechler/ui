## Implementing a Popover

In this quick tutorial, we will install and style the [Popover](../components/popover) component.

### 1. Install the primitive

Install Radix Primitives from your command line.

```bash
npm install radix-ui@latest
```

### 2. Import the parts

Import and structure the parts.

```jsx line=3,6-14
// index.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";

const PopoverDemo = () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger>More info</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content>
				Some more infoâ€¦
				<Popover.Arrow />
			</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);

export default PopoverDemo;
```

### 3. Add your styles

Add styles where desired.

```jsx line=4,8,10,12
// index.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Popover } from "radix-ui";
import "./styles.css";

const PopoverDemo = () => (
	<Popover.Root>
		<Popover.Trigger __className__="PopoverTrigger">Show info</Popover.Trigger>
		<Popover.Portal>
			<Popover.Content __className__="PopoverContent">
				Some content
				<Popover.Arrow __className__="PopoverArrow" />
			</Popover.Content>
		</Popover.Portal>
	</Popover.Root>
);

export default PopoverDemo;
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.PopoverTrigger {
	background-color: white;
	border-radius: 4px;
}

.PopoverContent {
	border-radius: 4px;
	padding: 20px;
	width: 260px;
	background-color: white;
}

.PopoverArrow {
	fill: white;
}
```

## Summary

The steps above outline briefly what's involved in using a Radix Primitive in your application.

These components are low-level enough to give you control over how you want to wrap them. You're free to introduce your own high-level API to better suit the needs of your team and product.

In a few simple steps, we've implemented a fully accessible Popover component, without having to worry about many of its complexities.

- Adheres to [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal) design pattern.
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled.
- Customize side, alignment, offsets, collision handling.
- Optionally render a pointing arrow.
- Focus is fully managed and customizable.
- Dismissing and layering behavior is highly customizable.
